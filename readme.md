What is an issue? Issues are items you can create in a repository to plan, discuss and track work.

What is a pull request? Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

How do I open up a pull request? Select the proper branch and at the top of the drop-down menu, click Pull Requests.

Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.
  Ask for the username of the person you're inviting as a collaborator.
  Navigate to the main page of the repository.
  Under your repository name, click  Settings.
  In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  Collaborators.
  Click Add people.
  In the search field, start typing the name of person you want to invite, then click a name in the list of matches.
  Click Add name to repository.
  The user will receive an email inviting them to the repository. Once they accept your invitation, they will have collaborator access to your repository.

What is the difference between git and GitHub?
Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code locally, whereas GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories and facilitating collaboration among developers.

What does git diff do?

git diff is a command in Git that displays the differences between changes made to files in your working directory and the staging area, or between the staging area and the repository, allowing you to see what modifications have been made to your code before committing them.

What is the main branch?
The default branch is also the initial branch that Git checks out locally when someone clones the repository.


h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
